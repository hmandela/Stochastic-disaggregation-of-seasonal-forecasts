Seasonal climate forecast temporal disaggregation 
Seasonal climate prediction is one of the best strategies for adapting to climate variability, especially in regions with strong interannual rainfall variability, such as West Africa. 
Three Stochastic Weather Generators (SWGs) were developed and applied in the Kandi area in Benin. These SWGs were used on consistent climatology with seasonal forecast.
